1. **Vocaloid Editor**: This is the main software interface where users can input lyrics, melodies, and adjust various parameters to produce vocal tracks.
    
2. **Phonetic Representation**: Vocaloid uses a system where users can input phonetic representations of lyrics to produce singing. This representation helps the software generate the correct sounds for each syllable.
    
3. **VSQ/VSQX Files**: These are the file formats used by Vocaloid to save and share project data. They contain information about the lyrics, melody, pitch, timing, and other settings.
    
4. **Vocaloid Expression Markup Language (VEXML)**: VEXML is a markup language that allows users to define various vocal expressions and characteristics. It's used to control nuances like vibrato, dynamics, pitch bend, and more.
    
5. **Voice Banks**: Each Vocaloid voice bank (e.g., Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin/Len) comes with its unique set of phonetic data, samples, and sometimes even specific scripting or controls tailored to that character's voice characteristics.
